- Turn these into issues in GitHub (maybe after the first POC is complete)
- audit novel repository; make sure:
    - When setNovel is called, novelDao is updated
    - when novelDao is udpated, setNovel is called
    - Likely refactor this into centralized common code that manages all mutability and exposes a'
      very simple interface
- revisit "openNovel" so chapters appear as they are downloaded while reading.
- Purge data for novels not saved to the library
- Allow reading chapters ad-hoc on novels not added to library
- UI / User Feedback for downloading and updating chapters
- Implement more sources! (at least 3, so I can stop assuming there's only 1)
- Theme the app

Parse bugs:

https://www.lightnovelpub.com/novel/omniscient-readers-viewpoint/265-chapter-67
This html is rendered wrong:
<p>–<i>Dokja-ssi, this person is perhaps…</i></p>

It becomes:
-

Dokja-ssi, this person is perhaps…

It should be:
-*Dokja-ssi, this person is perhaps…*

Likely, it's not parsing <i> as italics correctly atm.
This bug is probably in markdown

This HTML broke the whole thing:
<ul><li><em>Region of Campania, Italy, December 2008</em></li></ul>

On the site, it's just used for emphasis (don't know why there's a UL anyways)
But regardless, it shouldn't have put the rest of the content as a second bullet point.
